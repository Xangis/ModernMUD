        Ok, it seems to me that Thendar's Zone_Information_9.Txt is a most
  splendid introduction and explanation to the lifesucking process of zone
  writing.  A little pseudo-three-dimensional book that seems to live of its
  own freedom and set socio-tribal behaviors.  I might quote parts of her
  guide within this, so as to reiterate their significance.  But for the
  most part, this monstrosity has the distinct intention of teaching little
  tricks, cheats, and secrets that I (and possibly some others) have gathered
  like dusty jewels over the years.  Oh a few things, an advanced zone writer
  needs to absolutely try to follow these rules to attain mastery of his skill
  (the rank of Wizard [as earned by Inigo Montoya in William Goldman's action
  packed and extremely excellent book, "The Princess Bride", for swordsmanship]
  is near impossible to attain, and those that have would not call themselves
  Wizard Area Writers anyhow.  Though Xueqin comes damn close with his
  intricate multi-zone loads and quests.

         o  Five (ok, sometimes 4) to thirteen line room descriptions.
            Over thirteen and the screen totally just scrolls.
         o  Avoid Duping, or bury them enough so that they are
            not noticeable.
         o  Always have a plot/storyline or fantastic geography.
         o  Forever have a rational explanation for mobs/items/or
            traps (which are awesome).
         o  Attempt to use Mob_Distribution Rooms to make zones slightly
            different each repop.
         o  Avoid using the same word within like a sentence of each
            other.
         o  Always study others' zones, searching for their mistakes
            and/or things you can use to improve your own zones.
         o  NEVER, except under extreme circumstances, use non-cardinal
            exits (ie. nw, sw, ne, se) as they annoy players.
         o  Always place your color code (if using one) before the mandatory
            THREE-space indent before all Descriptions except room titles,
            which do not get indented (By now, you should know this).
         o  Never use "I", "You", etc, in room descriptions, or mob/obj
            long descriptions.  However, they can be used in Extra Room
            Descriptions, or obj/mob descriptions (The ones you see when
            you look at the mob/obj, not at the room).

 .'Item Statistics and Guidelines (Originally by Thendar, Altered by Snikt)`.

   At this time, we won't be adding more stoneskin eq, a buttload of
  max_con eq, etc. Please keep this in mind. I'd like to go back to
  pre-Shabboath equipment balance in the game. If you are using the
  newer editor please be conservative with the special bits.

 ATTRIBUTE BONUSES/PENALTIES:
   I'd like items to not boost a stat more than 1-3 for lower level
  equipment, 4-7 for higher. With very few exceptions, go over that
  with your own judgment. And remember, offsetting stuff with negatives
  doesn't necessarily make an item a bad piece of eq.  I don't want any
  max_con, max_anything really in lowbie-mid level zones, unless there
  is a very special reason (explanation to be included within your
  <Zone_name>.Txt file which should be included in zone submission).

 ARMOR VALUES:
  Below is a list of some standard ranges of AC values for the various
 equipment wear locations (that Xangis wrote up).  It's not really a rule
 that I'm going to check on each and every piece of equipment, but I don't
 want some magi having the wicked AC from hell either.

       "AC is based on the 100 to -100 point system. With a full
        suit of adamantine equipment of high quality, a player
        would have an unmodified AC of about -60. When dexterity
        bonuses, spell-ups, and silly magic earrings/rings are
        added, a player can easily get to -100."

  <Sniktiorg - Ok, I added the boxes, but all the I's in the
   following paragraphs are in reference to Thendar, not I, that
   is me, Sniktiorg.  Grok?  Well, if I totally wrote it, you will
   be able to tell by my sarcasm.  Snicker.>

 WEAPONS/DAMAGE/HIT:
  I'd like to keep the weapons, hit, and damage all relatively
 low on easy to obtain items. I don't see a need for an earring to
 give +3 dam unless it's magic, but I can see a spiked bracer
 inflicting some combat pain. I don't see any difference on these
 unless it's an artifact, in which case:
              .o. Talk to an Overlord about it.
              .o. Speak to Sniktiorg or Sarim, 
                  as they head the artifact 
                  research and development 
                  department. 
  _________________________________________________________________________

 | 2h Sword, w/Proc    |  5d5 |   6  |    6   |   (Use the new !Dual flag) |
 | 2h Sword, !Proc     |  6d6 |   6  |    6   |   Lance/battleaxe/etc.     |

                An example with a 2-handed sword would be:
                     Newbie swords:  1d4 - 1d6
                     Okay swords:    2d6 - 3d4
                     Good swords:    4d4 - 4d7
                     Badass swords:  5d6 - 6d6

                  An example with a dagger would be:
                     Newbie dagger:  1d3 - 1d5
                     Okay dagger:    2d4 - 3d3
                     Good dagger:    3d4 - 4d4
                     Badass dagger:  4d5 - 4d6

 ARTIFACTS/UNIQUES:  
  A unique is any weapon that has a perm_affect flag above 4th 
 circle, procs (one or more; though rareload/quest items may also proc), and has 
 hit dice that fall within the regular damage ranges for an item of that type.  
  An artifact is an item that has all of the above and has stats that are greater
 than the maximum stats allowed normally for an item of that type.  
  * Note: The more Perm_Affects or Procs an item has, the more chance it has of 
 becoming an Artifact.  Players may only wield one Artifact at a time, whereas 
 they may have a few uniques at a time.


 SIZE/QUALITY/MATERIALS:
  Basically these all affect the price of an item when it is bought or sold.
 Perhaps, in the future, these things may change their usage.

 WEIGHT:
  This does matter. It makes a sword not dualable (about 20 Lbs, though the
 use of the !dual flag makes this nonessential), for instance.  It makes
 players encumbered when they carry 32 sets of adamantine platemail, or not
 able to move at all!

 EXTRA BITS/FLAGS:
  At the risk of repeating myself, please don't add stoneskin eq, etc. If
 you absolutely think your zone NEEDS this item, explain why in the *.Txt
 file about your zone.  However, it would be wise to consult an Overlord
 beforehand.

 TAKEABILITY OF OBJECTS:
  Make sure that all items meant to be taken by a PC are takeable.  Quite
 often people will put items, which aren't worn by the mob but meant for
 PCs, in an inventory and forget to flag it takeable.  People often forget
 to make keys takeable as well.

  <Snikt - Ok, I'm rewriting what Thendar said about arti's, item descripts,
   and extra descriptions, as I feel the following to be more suitable.  But,
   do remember, I am just a writer, I have no true say in matters.>

 ARTIFACTS:
  Artifacts should be hard to get, possibly through quest or some crack-maze
 zone filled with rabid demons from unmentionable planes of hell; well, the
 artifacts that contain flags such as haste, detect invis, mass invis, or any
 other crazy effects.  A good idea for the artifact flag is use with named
 objects, such as A dagger named 'Silencer'.  Hell, perhaps an item in a quest
 could be flagged as an artifact, making it all the harder to complete the
 quest as the first group would quickly find itself hunted by another group
 of would-be adventurers.  Generally, big artifacts are most likely to be
 refused by the Overlords, as artifacts have a heavy effect on game balance.

 ITEM DESCRIPTIONS:
  Make sure that the objects' keywords match all signifiers in the objects'
 long description (the one shown to the room when the item is on the floor).
 All objects are to have a main description (mandatory of at least three to
 four lines of text), you can add extra item descriptions if you like
 (though optional it can cause a nifty effect, such as a rope and bucket in
 a well, all three can have their own descriptions improving the zone's look
 overall.  Or, to cite an example from my Kyderach Province, there is an herb
 found in the northern forests.  You can look at the plant itself, and then
 at the buds that grow upon it).

 INDENTING AND CAPITALIZATION:
  Ok, listen well, cause most people really FUBAR this one.  Indent all your
 descriptions by three spaces on the first line.  Not one space, not four, nor
 even more.  Exactly three.  Also, place the Diku/Magma color codes before the
 indent or you will negate it.  Proper names are to be capitalized.

  Titles are a bit different, only the words with any real significance get
 capitalized, the linking words (such as the, with, by, near, in, a, or, etc)
 remain in lowercase.  Also, you do not indent titles.  Please for the love of
 Gawd, if you respect yourself and your art, don't forget this lesson.

 .'               DIKU/Magma Color Code (by Thendar and Sniktiorg)         `.

 DIKU/MAGMA COLOR CODES:
  With the exception of black, the color code system is simple to understand.
 In a nutshell; the case of the first letter of the color preceded by &+ will
 dictate the color printed on the screen.  &+R would be bright red, while the
 &n&+r (&n turns off the color's high-bit, basically returning it to the darker
 shades of the spectrum.  Xangis has assured me that it is no longer required,
 however using the &n before a dark color prevents any chance of color bleed,
 through code or some other such crapola.  Actually, aside from being a habit
 from my Duris days, its sort of a signature.  The mark of an artist, the
 small touch that differentiates a master from a journeyman.

  There are 4 types of ANSI control sequences: (Thendar Briefly)
   &<N>|<n>  - Reset everything, back to 'n'ormal (PC default color on black).
               This can also be done for every newline, to eliminate 'bleed-
               through' colors, though its only truly needed if the last color
               on the preceding line has its High Bit engaged.
   &+<color> - Set foreground color.  If the color letter is uppercase, the
               high-bit (bright/light) is also set (and will STAY set) until
               an &n is done.
   &-<color> - Set background color.  If the color letter is uppercase, the
               BLINK bit will be set (same as for &+ above).
  &=<bg><fg> - set both background <bg> and foreground <fg> color, exactly
               the same restrictions as for setting foreground and background
               separately.
     ____________________________________________________________________
    | Current Color Code Seqences, For Some Reason Pre-Win ANSI Only Has |
    |  but 8 or 15 Colors.  Most Programmers are Very short-sighted.     |

 COLORATION AND MOOD CONSTRUCTION:
  Color can have an intense affect on a zone's overall mood.  Generally each
 person develops their own palette ideas, however, I will explain a few
 techniques that I (as well as Beretorn and some others) use or have used that
 seem to look pretty decent.  Well to my poor eyes, anyhows.

  Room descriptions can come in any available color, obviously, however in the
 short time I have been doing this, I have found but a few suitable base tints
 which seem to hold the best effects.

  First, one has to decide the amount of light that illuminates the room, as
 well as the type of terrain you are using.  I prefer to use Black (Pardon,
 Dark Grey) as my principle color, being that it allows me to use the remaining
 colors to better accent my descriptions.  This is not to say black is the end
 all, be all, of choices.

  Mountains, hills, and such, I ussually color with a brown base (as well as
 those forests that are lit by some sort of light or that are meant to lend a
 feeling of calm or serenity).

  Prairies, grasslands, and some forests I will use either dark or light green
 (dark green works best) as my description background color, to give the feel
 of being at one of these spots.

  In the Underdark, it is prevelent to see rooms and their titles done complete
 with dark maroon tones.  This is a vestigial remain from Duris and the more
 primitive muds.  I tend to keep the purple when highlighting words such as
 tunnel, wall, stalactite, stalagmite, etc.  For the rest I rely on my trusty
 black.  Afterall, it is the underdark, and without sun, blackness would seem
 to be a major factor.  That and the fact that large amounts of magenta tends
 toward a guady 1973-1977ev appearance.

  Again, this is my technique.  Don't take this as law.  I never mixed cyans
 and magentas until I met Thendar, now I find the combination to be useful in
 certain situations.  Steal with your eyes, taking what you can use and leaving
 what you cannot; learn whatever you can to improve your skills.  Unfortunately
 to writers, until the players map a zone or discover some crazy EXP/EQ they
 will generally enter zones they are dragged to or that look amazing.  So in
 the beginning, any areas you write will be mostly for yourself and the friends
 you bring there.  I say this for but one reason (and I am damn guilty of doing
 it in my Duris days), cranking out mediocrity for the sake of having your name
 in the list of Writers just lowers your reputation, and will eventually begin
 to bother you as you realize how much better you could have done.

 COLOR BLENDING TECHNIQUES:
  Being there are but fifteen actual colors to choose from, one finds oneself
 often at a loss for which hue to use on which word, etc.  That's where the
 following systems come in handy.

  Two-tone schemes are the most used, as they tend not to look too overdone.
 One can do this a few ways, here are but two:  Divide the colors by the
 syllables within the word, or by arbitrarily choosing a place which seems
 most pleasing to the eye.

  This can be improved upon to form such things as my Rakropolis Forest, or
 the colors of my newer water supplies.  Simply, before I attempt to define
 it, all one does is pick two colors (for now we shall call them 1 an 2,
 while letters shall be represented by X's) and follow this procedure:
 1XX2X1X2XX1X2X1XX, etc.  or  1X2XX1X2X1XX2X1X2XX, etc.  Improv, be creative
 and discover you might be a hidden Van Gogh.  Below, I give an example of
 how I do my forest (Note - Cut and Paste helps sometimes with this).

            &n&+gFo&+Gr&n&+ge&+Gst&n (note the color-reset &n)

  That would show up as the word forest written as if the leaves of the trees
 were casting shadows as you looked upon them.  I do this simply.  I start out
 with one color, use that color for 2 letters, then the second color for one
 letter.  Back to the first color, but this time but one letter while the
 other color is promoted to two letters.  I repeat this pattern until the end
 of the word.  Experiment, you will find some neat color combinations, such
 as white and either cyan (or bright blue for that matter) which forms a nice
 ice/glacial pattern.

  Typically I use an alternation between dark and light cyan for words that
 signify water, and I build most of my zones on a dark grey lettering, unless
 in a forest (during daylight or when I want a safer looking feeling) or desert
 (brown), air (bright cyan), or in water (bright blue; sometimes dark blue to
 denote deeper waters).  I'm not suggesting this for everyone, I just find it
 gives the area an eerie look.

  Oh, one last thing, unless used in an ascii image (such as some of those to
 be found in this guide later), try not to change the background colors, it
 really makes a zone look poor.  Another good idea is to look at the color DE
 uses for your obj's material when making one, so that a mithril sword is the
 same color as mithril.  Though I admit some-times its best to go with one's
 own judgement.  Also, when possible use the same color for certain words within
 your zone (ie. all the words 'female' could be light cyan, or whatever.  This
 lends your zone an overall appearance of unity.  Again, maybe only drow females
 are done in light cyan, while duergar females are done in dark cyan.  The
 possibilities are endless).

 COLORATION WARNINGS/ADVICE:
  Unless you are very talented, the combination of red and green lends a heavy
 atmosphere of Christ-Mass, which if yer into that, cool, otherwise it can look
 sorta silly, IMHO.  Another, miniscule point, try not to abuse yellow, white,
 or dark blue, as they strain the eyes.

  Generally I'll only use yellow to represent gold, blonde hair, or objects
 like straw.  White on the other hand, I'll use on such things as books,
 paper, or creatures that you're constantly scanning for either because they
 are guards or beings like Euronymous from The Domain of Lost Souls Castle.

 .'  Creating Ships and Vehicles (Version I) by Xangis (Almost Verbatim)   `.

  With the addition of the ship/vehicle values to DE should come some form
 of explanation.  Here's my first attempt.  As always, if you're not clear
 on how something works, or whether it will fit into the game theme, ask!

 make sure you have the most recent version of this guide.  It can be found

|               The ship and vehicle values mean the following:              |
|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Vnum of Key:         This is the vnum of the key required to be            |
|                      considered the "owner" of the boat.  This should      |
|                      correspond the the vnum of any keys needed to         |
|                      get into the ship (i.e. a locked door in the entry    |
|                      room if any)  Leave zero if no key is required to     |
|                      board and operate the ship.  If you want nobody to    |
|                      be able to operate the ship, just create a key that   |
|                      doesn't load and set the value to that key.           |
| Vnum of Boarding Rm: This is the room that someone will end up in when     |
|                      they board the ship or vehicle.  Essentially the      |
|                      starting room and the room from which they can dis-   |
|                      embark.                                               |
| Vnum of Control Rm:  This is the vnum of the room where the control panel  |
|                      displaying things like hull points, speed, direction, |
|                      and firepower is located, and also the only room from |
|                      which the room can be controlled.  If you don't want  |
|                      anyone to be able to look at a control panel, leave   |
|                      this set to zero.                                     |
| Maximum Occupants:   The maximum number of people that can be on the ship  |
|                      at the same time.                                     |
| Max Speed:           The maximum speed of the ship in a range of 1 to 100. |
|                      If set at zero the ship cannot move.  Your average    |
|                      frigate should move at about 40-50.  Canoe-caliber    |
|                      boats should be 10-20 and fast galleons should be 60- |
|                      80.                                                   |
| Hull Points:         Essentially the hitpoints of the ship.  A standard    |
|                      canoe or raft has 100, a sloop has 500, a frigate has |
|                      1000, and a galleon 1500.  Things with 10000 should   |
|                      be the size of small planets.                         |
| Firepower:           The maximum number of hull points damage that can be  |
|                      done in a round of ship combat (if everything hits    |
|                      for full damage).  Set depending upon how heavily     |
|                      armed the ship should be.  Some good values are 50    |
|                      for sloops, 100 for frigates, and 150 for galleons.   |
|                      Things with 500 should be able to take out small      |
|                      planets. <Snikt - Repetative, aint he?  Perhaps he    |
|                      was watching Star Wars.>                              |
| Mv Script Number:    This corresponds to the movement script for the ship. |
|                      If you want automated ship movement (usually used     |
|                      when the "vnum of key" value is set to a key that     |
|                      doesn't load), you assign it here.  Just make it a    |
|                      non-zero number so we know there is a script writ.    |
|                      If you are really smooth you'd ask Xangis what the    |
|                      next available ship script number was before filling  |
|                      this out.                                             |

 something that would indicate just what the hell it is) and include the

 and move the ship according to the pattern.

 .'              The Secret of Room Descriptions (Sniktiorg)               `.

   As a writer I know the doldrums of trying to come up with distinct room
  descriptions for every room in my zones.  Finding myself relying on silly
  cop-outs such as dripping water, messages scrawled on walls, a pool of red
  or yellow liquid, a pile of bones, scratches in the walls, collapsed tunnel
  shafts, algae, fungi, slime, and all sorts of stuff that just keeps popping
  up in different sentences throughout my zones  Let's face it, a tunnel has
  much the same features (except perhaps to a geologist) throughout its entire
  course.  How many ways can you describe the same thing.  I wrote like 150
  forest rooms, all individual, within my Kyderach Province, and let me tell
  you, it was no cherry of a virgin.  So, here's a little trick I developed
  way back in my Duris days, though I have improved upon it some.  Its a very
  simple principle really, just try and grok.

  HIDING DUPED ROOMS:
   Put to case you have a tunnel that is 20 rooms long, all writhen and lined
  with various underdark-cave crapola.  Now, take 20 and divide that by let's
  say 5.  So, you need write but 4 room descriptions instead of 20.

   Now, write your first room description, leaving out all color codes and
  avoiding mention of exits.  If you can, put a return between each of the
  sentences.  Save this file as Diku.tmp then assemble the sentences into a
  normal paragraph and add in the color codes (however, don't yet mention any
  exits).  Save this version to the file Dikux.tmp for use later.

   This done, add in the references to where the exits lie, etc.  Save this
  file as Dikued.tmp so as to replace your current room (this is important).
  Walk 4 rooms down the tunnel, edit the room description, load Dikux.tmp and
  add this room's exits to the text.  Once again, save this as Dikued.tmp to
  replace your current room descript.  Do this until five of the twenty rooms
  are complete.

   Repeat this process 3 more times, for the remaining rooms, with but one
  alteration.  Remember Diku.Tmp?  Well, load her up and alter some words,
  sentence placement, and now u have your second/third/or fourth room descrip-
  tion.  As the room descriptions are not bunched too close to each other, it
  should give the illusion of actual writing.

   You can theoretically use this technique in a few variations, such as
  increasing number of different descriptions or even attempting to create all
  20 rooms from the sentences in Diku.tmp.  Either way, though it detracts
  slightly from zone quality it most definately speeds up production.  For
  added spunk, change the colors of the words you choose to highlight, or even
  color different words.

   (Sidebar - A stalagmite climbs up from the floor, and a stalactite hangs
  from the ceiling.  It takes about one-hundred years for a single inch of
  limestone to add to the size of these formations.  This is a good thing to
  know when you are telling the age of a cavern covered with either of these
  stone knives).

  GRIDS AND DUPING:
   In grids, there are two ways of duping I have developed.  If the grid is of
  a circular/square shape, you would use the above technique in concentric
  loops toward the grid's center.  Each loop should describe the grid from its
  placement in the cavern/chamber/etc.
   If the grid is longer in one direction than the other, just divide the
  overall grid into 3 to X times and use the G-14 Classified Dupe technique to
  define each section from its position as you move down the cavern.  Honestly,
  grids are about the only time I dupe any more. As is a 5 by 5 grid is some 25
  rooms.  Screw that.  Bad enough doing a hundred forestal paths.  At least the
  path turns and has trees, ivy, roots, stones, dirt, ferns, etc.  A 25-foot
  cubed room looks much the same from all over the place.

   (Oh yes, another sidebar - Though duped rooms are considered in poor taste,
  they can be used to your advantage.  For example, in mazes, duped rooms can
  be used to confuse players and keep them lost for hours.  Cackle.  Also,
  one could create 3 duped mobs all of different levels and abilities, so as
  to make players think twice about who they attack, while helping trophy.)

  EXTRA ROOM DESCRIPTIONS:
   Though Thendar is quite right that these are really not needed, they can be
  used to great benefit for the writer.  Why write all these room descriptions
  if every Jobu, Dauwod, and Grizzl is gunna run around with brief on?  Well,
  use extra room descriptions.  Describe statues that hold secret quest words,
  or draw maps on walls in mazes (nice trick, as unless you read the room you
  will remain lost in the maze and you dont waste a noshow obj doing the same
  thing).  Run out of things to say in your standard room description?  Hell,
  put the phrase "Someone has scribbled a &+Cmessage&n upon the wall." within
  the room description, then make an extra description with all the codes to
  Rouge Squadron(tm) like I did in the caves of the Kyderach Province.  Shite,
  quote a song, ramble at the player, tell a joke, who cares, you just filled
  a line in your room's long descript.  Aside from items, this is the only
  place one is allowed to directly address the PC, as to do so in a normal
  room description would make it look odd when someone casts a spell like
  clair or wizard eye, or whatever farseeing spells we have now.

  GENERAL ROOM IDEAS:
   The easiest way to write a room description is to close yer eyes and just
  think about what you imagine there.  What do you see?  Is the skull on the
  mantle or the desk?  What's it smell like?  Is the air moist, dusty, moldy,
  dry, hot, etc?  What furniture is in the room?  Well, that can very much
  depend on who's room it is.  Firb Derstl for instance, Burrow Warden of the
  Dirk'nspire Stronghold, has a desk, some maps, a duty roster, chair, strong-
  box, etc.  While one of my ogryn homes in my Kardis mini-zone has but a head-
  less corpse, some bloodstains, cracked plaster, and wood rafters under a
  leaking thatch roof.  Use your five senses!  Sight, Scent, Hearing (Oh,
  shite was that the roar of the enigmatic Jade Monkey?), touch, taste (if
  you can work it in somehow, without using "I" or "you", which can be done
  easily by substituting the words "one" or "someone").


  DEFAULT ROOMS AND EXITS:
   Tired of having to add those exit messages to every room?  Most area penmen
  know about the command 'edit defroom', a feature which allows you to walk
  and create your zone with very duped room names, though its nice for quickly
  setting an area with the proper flags, etc.  It is advisable that afterwards,
  you walk your newly plotted area and edit room titles here and there to
  include turns, cliffs, or any other such landmarks.
   However, not many know about the command 'Edit Defexit', which is basically
  the same as 'edit defroom' designed to work for exits.  Look how you can set
  that exit message and not have to worry about doing it manually or, as I used
  to, go through the *.Wld file and add them that way.  You can use this to set
  doors, arches, and standard passages.  Nice time saver, and it lends the zone
  more class.  I mean hey, the more effort you put into a zone the better it
  will look and be recieved by the players.  You might also want to use the
  'alias' command as you will find yerself using these funtions a lot.  I
  ussually set my alias' as:

                            Alias co Createedit Obj
                            Alias cm Createedit Mob
                            Alias edr Edit Defroom
                            Alias edx Edit Defexit

   Remember, default rooms and exits create files in your zone directory, so
  delete them before sending it all up to Thendar, as she surely doesn't need
  them.

 .'            Improved !Show and Teleport Uses (Sniktiorg)                `.

   One great improvement that Basternae has made over Duris lies within the
  code of the !show and Teleport Obj/Functions.

  !SHOW OBJECTS:
   On Duris (If you never heard of it, you aren't missing much) when one were
  to pull an item from a !show obj, it would say "Juboo gets a bone from some-
  thing.", while Basternae actually says "Tarlith grabs a tome from the case."
  This allows for a more realistic look, as I'm sure if I grab something from
  someplace I should damn well know what I'm reaching into.
   One can use this for crevices in rockfaces, bookshelves, lockers, small
  tables, iceboxes, secluded hiding places in a thieves den, etc.  A grand
  tool for use in long quests, or short ones.  A word to the wise, once a PC
  learns to complete a mini-quest, they tend to abuse it for its simplicity
  and easier access to whatever items may be involved, thus its better for
  use in longer quests.

  TELEPORTATION OBJECTS:
   Items set as Teleport have too been changed.  When you type 'Climb Rope' it
  now says 'You climb <obj short name>'.  What this means to you as a writer
  is this: obj's that use words like climb or cut or something similar, it
  would be wise to make the obj short name fit the phrase.  For example, name
  the rope 'up the &n&+yrope&n through the &n&+mceiling&n' so as the player
  sees 'You climb up the rope through the ceiling.'  This is better than the
  older 'Soder disappears.' or the stupid 'Soder enters from somewhere.'
  messages that would appear upon this object_type's use.

  ENTERABLE/DRINKABLE WATERFALLS:
   Ok, how do you set an item to be two different items, both a fountain and a
  teleporter?  Well, quite honestly you can't.  But you can cheat a little.
  Create two objs, one of which is !show.  Make the waterfall a teleporter,
  set to teleport to the room directly behind the falls (which should be set
  to silent as the echo of the descending water would drown out the room in
  noise), and [if it is !show, make its long descript say something like "Type
  'Enter Waterfall' to pass by." or whatever] make its keywords simply falls,
  waterfall, and maybe like cave, crevice, or tunnel depending.  There's half
  the project.
   Next make your second obj, the fountain, into a pool.  This item should be
  visible, and its long description should read "A waterfall collects in a
  small pool, here." or something to that effect.  Set the pool's keywords to
  water pond pool (as long as niether obj shares keywords).  This effectively
  creates a drinking pool at the base of a waterfall, and both items appear as
  one, so unless you read the room (or this guide) you will think that it is a
  simple pool for adventurers to drink.
   As an aside, the reason you set the first keyword of a Drink Container to
  its liquid, is that the code does this often: Gilgarus fills his <skin item>
  with <first keyword of drink container> from the <drink container>.  So if my
  fountain's first keyword is fountain, it would say: Gilgarus fills his skin
  with fountain from the ivory fountain.  Grok?  Maybe Xangis altered it so
  that it just uses the liquid type assigned instead of the first keyword, but
  never hurts to be on the side of caution.  By the way, this waterfall trick
  can be converted to wells and other such things.

 .'         Tips on Hindering Player Cheese-abuse (Sniktiorg)              `.

   As is human nature (when unmastered by self-will), most players will
  abuse anything they can.  Partially because it either gives them a false
  sense of self-importance, or because they get tired sitting around killing
  the same mobs.  Even different mobs can feel like every other spider or
  troll, myconid, etc.  So, here are some tips on preventing PC's from
  abusing an oversight on your part, turning your big bad creature into a
  rather simple mob to kill.  (Some of this you may already know, but for
  the benefit of those who don't, here it is.)

  NO LURE/RANGE/GANG-SLAUGHTER DESIGN:
   Okay, lets say you make a Guardian Ice Giant that holds the key to
  Valhala, but you don't want the mob cheesed by casters or four tanks,
  etc.  Well, you can do this two ways, even combining the two will work;
  though you should keep in mind not to make the ice giant into superman.

   First, you can set the mob's affect flags (well in an ice giant's case
  fireshield or any other heat generating affect would not fit the mob
  so should be avoided).  Giants are anywhere from normal speed to slow,
  because of their heights and dimwits they can/don't need the slowness
  flag).  This is one way to make hir tougher, aside from adding +1 to
  hir size.  However, this doesn't make it too dangerous for the group
  who is adventuring his lair.  What else, you ask?  Try this:

  ÚÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ¿                      | <- Entrance to

   Ok, here's the *.WLD file portion of this obstacle (this can be combined
  with the mob statting that precedes this for an even harsher effect).  DE
  allows many room flags that, when used correctly, can make life trying
  for players and thusly increases the rush of reward when the trial is
  complete.

   Down to the nitty-gritty.  First thing you need to decide is how tough
  do you want the mob to be to kill.  The tougher you want it, the more
  room flags you will use.  Just as a reminder, these are some (not all) of
  the qualities of the room flags vital to this project.

   Okay, to begin with (using the map above) everything left of the northern
  door is flagged !Magic, Dark, !Heal, Tunnel, !Farsee, !Scan, Single-File,
  !Magic (Don't need healers making things easy), !Summon/Well/Portal, and
  perhaps the northern door needs another key to get out of the death hall.
  Place the Giant well at the back of the tunnel and make him sentinal, so
  he wont track the players to an easier terrain.  Also, set his room, and
  only his room to heal.  This gives him a hell of an advantage, especially
  if he is a warrior or rogue, as the area is no magic, so only healing
  potions will be of use.

   To be extremely rude, you can make a few portals in the hallway, one which
  leads to the giant (2 or so uses before it cakes) while the other portals
  take the splintering group to differnt places, from which they must search
  out the giant's chamber again.  This trick forces larger parties to split
  for a bit so that they can't just all bum rush him (though with single-
  file and tunnel set, they can't really jump him at once).  Hell, you can
  even use MOBProgs (explained by Ski, elsewhere) to add some neat little
  surprise.  Let your imagination run wild.

.'            Makings of a Portal (Coded and Written by Sniktiorg)         `.

   When defining a portal in DikuEdit, set Value4 to the following to get
  the desired results:

       0 -- Standard Portal (No Frills)
       1 -- Wormhole Effect (Plus Stumble)
       2 -- Moonwell Effect (Wades & Flash)
  
   To add a message which the players see when going through the portal, add an extra
  description with _portal_ as its keyword.

 .'    The Basics of Random/Rare Load Grids (Amassed by Thendar/Snikt)     `.

   <Snikt - Thendar basically took the time to write this all out, I just
    went through it and made it a bit more efficient and lined up the grids
    for better ease of use.  Though don't forget to make the Distribution
    Grids flagged: !Recall, !Teleport, !Well, ect.  This prevents PCs from
    entering restricted Areas.>


  Example 1: Rare Load Equipment and Random Load Location. (Vecna's)

            6
     Grid   |           1: The initial load room Ali loads in.
       I    4           2: Ali's exit path for item #1
            |           3: Ali's exit path for item #2
    6 - 5 - 1 - 3 - 6   4: Ali's exit path for item #3
            |           5: Ali's exit path for item #4
            2           6: Ali's loading grid, one way out...
            |           7: Exit to crypt #1
            6           8: Exit to crypt #2
                        9: Exit to crypt #3
   Grid     7 11       10: Exit to crypt #4
    II      |/         11: Exit to load location #5
        8 - 6 - 9      12: Exit to load location #6
            |\
           10 12       <Snikt - Exits 11 and 12 are up and down, not
                        the ridiculous ne and se that they appear to
                        be; ascii does have limits.>

   This is actually the best load method I've seen to do random equipment
  with. The mob starts at 1, and has 4 one-way exits to the equipment (the mob
  is !sentinel and scavenger).  From those equipment rooms, it goes to room 6,
  which has exits out into the zone.  There are 6 different places in the zone
  for it to load.

   This grid is basically 25% chance of loading different equipment, and 100%
  chance of loading the mob. If you added dead ends from room 6, you would get
  less than 100% load for the mobs. If you only had eq in room 2, but not 3,
  4, or 5, you'd have a 25% load for eq.


   Example 2: A Simple Rare Load Mob Grid.

         2
         |              1: The mob starts here, and is !sentinel.
      2--1--2           2: Mob trap room, has no exits.
         |              3: Mob load out to zone.
         3
         |
        zone

   This is a very simple grid, it can be elaborated on I just made it easy for
  the sake of explanation.  Basically the more chances of the mob being
  trapped, the more rare the mob is.  This is a common technique not just for
  big equip, but for more inventive stuff such as pieces of a quest, etc.


   Example 3: Hack n' Slash Loads

   Basically, from one mob load room, you have the one way exits: u, d, n, ne,
  e, se, s, sw, w, nw. From these, there are trap rooms, or more grids (or a
  loop back to the grid). Mobs in this grid will load very rarely, but always
  have the equipment they are known for (ie, "Jalharoth, Angel of Death" in
  Mansion would always load with the blade of heaven).

    <Snikt - Non-cardinal directions are fine in mob distribution rooms
     as if u flag them correctly no one can get into them.>


   Example 4: Quests Over Many Different Zones
              (Xueqin Created this if I am correct. Snikt.)

            5            1: The mob starts here, and is !sentinel.
            |            2: Mob loads in zone #1.
        2 - 1 - 4        3: Mob loads in zone #2.
            |            4: Mob loads in zone #3.
            3            5: Mob loads in zone #4.


   This is a very simplified grid that I've seen Xueqin use, cause he rules.
  Never really thought of it.  Basically, if you want items or mobs in zones
  other than your own, for a quest in your zone, you can have them load in
  zones, beside the zone they belong to, while still very much a part of your
  area.  This grid would have a lot of trap rooms, to make the occurances of
  these rare mobs very uncommon.

   <Snikt, again.  These are basic distribution rooms, most of which date
    back before the Sojourn Dissolution into Toril and Duris.  They are not
    The end all be all of distro technology.  For instance you can place
    guards, aggros, animals of somekind, or whatever else fits yer zone,
    into these sort of grids (as well as a few in the actual zone), in
    order to make your zone population different everytime.  Why is that
    you ask?  Simple, the mobs in the zone will automatically pop at zone
    reset, however those who find themselves in a trap room of the
    distribution chamber, won't enter the actual zone until reboot.  Grok?
    This means there will be times when rabid two-headed gerbils are
    roaming your abandoned village of sedate tabloid robots, but at other
    times you might only encounter one as the rest are trapped in a
    deadzone.>

 .'                     Adding a Pet Shop (Sniktiorg)                      `.
   
   Ever been playing in those early hours of the night and wished you could
  buy a slave to tank for you?  Or perhaps yer running across the continent
  trying to get from Stormport to the Phoenix River and you can't find a good
  mount shop anywhere?  Here's how to add one to your zones.

   First set up two rooms, their vnums must run consecutively (ie. rm 1 and
  rm 2).  Flag the first room as a petshop, put in a mob for your shopkeep
  (though the shop is based on a rm flag, not on the mob like an obj shop),
  and delete the exit from this room into room 2.

   Room 2 is the, for lack of a better term, corral.  This room holds the
  animals, slaves, mounts, et al that the shop will be selling.  You can
  leave the exit connecting this room with the shop as it doesn't matter,
  you only deleted the other side as you don't want players wandering into
  this room and fubaring your operation.  This room you flag as !Summon,
  !Teleport, and !Well/Portal/Etc; this is to ensure, once again, that nobody
  wanders onto your premises and fiddles with the farm animals.

   Its a good idea to flag the pets as Sentinal, so they don't wander out of
  the corral and into the shop.  If a mob leaves the corral, the shop ceases
  to carry that animal.  You can use this to your advantage if you want, by
  making a room off the corral.  Then delete the exit into the main shop and
  leave off the sentinal flags on the mobs.  As the mobs wander back and
  forth between the rooms, the shops inventory will change.

   While a mob is in the corral room, the shop will carry an infinite supply
  of said mob.  The price of the animals is set by the code; which takes into
  account the level of the mob and what flags you have set on it.  Needless to
  say, the more you add, the more the code will add.

   If you would like more races added, just talk to an Immortal and we can work
  something out.  (As a side note, our current Dikuedit doesn't handle making
  quests very well.  If you want to add a quest to your zone, just put the mob
  and obj vnums and the explanation of the quest in the *.txt file that you 
  submit along with your completed zone.

                      edits an entity specified by vnum (or keyword for objs/
                      mobs in the room, direction for exits).
                      Default rooms/objs/mobs/exits detailed below

        CreateEdit  - takes at least one argument, with the format

                      (exit direction required for exits) - creates an entity
                      and edits it in one command

        Check       - takes no arguments - checks entities for common mistakes,
                      such as missing descs, doors with no keywords, etc.  all

                               mobhere/mh|defroom|defobj|defmob|defexit>
                               [vnum/exit direction]"
                      (exit direction required for exits, no vnum for default
                       room/obj/mob/exit) - deletes an entity of the specified
                       type

        Load        - takes two arguments, with the format
                      "load <object|mob> <vnum>" - creates an object/mobHere
                      in the current room with the specified vnum

        Clone       - takes three arguments, with the format
                      "clone <room|object|mob> <vnum> [# to clone]" - clones
                      room/objtype/mobtypes <# to clone> times, copying all
                      attributes of the cloned entity - if the last argument
                      is left out, one clone is made

        Purge       - takes up to one argument, with the format
                      "purge <vnum|keyword|all|allobj|allmob|inv>" - purges
                      obj/mobHeres when a vnum or keyword is specified, "all"
                      deletes all objects and mobs in the zone, "allobj" and
                      "allmob" delete all objects/mobs, "inv" deletes
                      everything in your inventory - if no argument is
                      specified, deletes all objects and mobs in current
                      room

        Copy        - takes at least three arguments, with the format
                      "copy desc <room|mob> <source vnum> [dest vnum]" or
                      "copy default <room|object|mob|exit> [source vnum/exit]"

                      "desc" copies the description of a room/mob to a target
                      room/mob.  When copying roomdescs and leaving out
                      dest vnum, the current room is assumed as the
                      destination.

                      "default" copies the attributes of a room/object/mob/exit
                      to the target default room/object/mob/exit.  Leaving out
                      the vnum for a source room copies the current room,
                      and exits require a source direction, not a source
                      vnum.

                      For instance, typing 'copy def object 1453' would
                      copy the attributes of object 1453 into the default
                      object (defaults covered below).

        MassSet     - takes three arguments, with the format "massset
                      <room|obj|mob> <flagname> <on/1|off/0>"

                      this command turns a particular flag on or off
                      for every room, obj, or mob.  for instance,
                      typing "massset room safe off" would turn the
                      SAFE bit off in every room in the zone.

        SetRandom/  - takes two arguments, with the format "random
        Random        <keyword of mob/obj to change> <random %age>"

                      this command sets the percentage a particular
                      object or mob has to load into the zone, from 1-100%.
                      this can only be used on object/mobHeres, and not
                      types themselves


  ZONE-RELATED COMMANDS:

        SetZoneNumber/  - takes one argument, with the format
        SZN               "szn <zonenumb>" - sets all the internal zone
                          flags in .WLD and zone number flag in the
                          .ZON to number specified in zonenumb (note
                          that this can also be done from the "edit zone"
                          menu)

        ReNumber        - can take one argument, with the format
                          "ren [start vnum]" - if no argument is specified,
                          rooms/objs/mobs are renumbered from lowest vnum in
                          list, and gaps in numbering are removed.  if an
                          argument is specified, rooms/objs/mobs are
                          renumbered starting at number specified.

        ReNumberRooms/  - exactly like the 'RENUMBER' command, except that
        ReNRooms          only rooms are renumbered

        ReNumberObjects/- exactly like the 'RENUMBER' command, except that
        ReNObjects        only objects are renumbered

        ReNumberMobs/   - exactly like the 'RENUMBER' command, except that
        ReNMobs           only mobs are renumbered (imagine that)

        Limit           - takes three arguments, with the format
                          "limit <obj|mob> <vnum> <limit>" - use this command
                          to override the limit dikuEdit automatically
                          writes to the .ZON file for an object/mob type -
                          can also be used for objects/mobs not in the
                          .OBJ/.MOB file, btw


  ROOM/EXIT COMMAND(S):

        Grid        - takes up to three arguments, with the format
                      "grid <x size> <y size> [z size]" - creates a grid of
                      rooms, all interconnected, with the specified size.  if
                      a default room and/or default exit are defined, they
                      are copied in, so that you can make a large forest
                      with a simple grid command, or hey, even a large
                      desert.  it's all up to you, the zone creator.

        LinkRooms   - takes up to two arguments, with the format
                      "linkrooms <room1> [room2] <exit dir>" - creates
                      an exit leading from room1 to room2 in the direction
                      specified and an exit leading from room2 to room1
                      in the opposite direction.  if the room2 argument
                      is left out, room1 is assumed to be the current room
                      and the number entered as the first argument is
                      assumed to be the destination room.  (i.e. typing
                      'linkrooms 3993 nw' from room #3990 would create
                      an exit in room #3990 to the northwest leading to
                      3993, and an exit in #3993 leading southeast to
                      room #3990.  simple eh?)

        CheckMap    - checks a map for 'mapness'..  if you know how maps
                      are set up, it makes sense

        SwapExits   - takes two arguments, with the format
                      "swapexits <exit dir1> <exit dir2>" - this command
                      simply swaps the two exits specified (can also swap
                      exits that don't exist with those that do)

        SwapNS      - takes no arguments - swaps all north and south exits
                      (hey, it's kinda neat)

        SwapWE      - takes no arguments - swaps all west and east exits

        SwapUD      - takes no arguments - swaps all up and down exits


  OBJECT COMMANDS:

        FixCond  - takes no arguments, sets all object types with
                   conditions less than 100 to 100.  added because I kept
                   getting zones where all the conditions are 0...  :)


  MOB COMMANDS:

        Give     - same as PUT, but makes more sense conceptually when giving
                   objects to mobs

                   alternatively, if you specify a vnum, the object will be
                   loaded and put into the mob's inventory list automatically.

        GiveC    - same as PUTC (gives a copy of obj|mob to target.

        Equip    - takes at least one argument, with the format
                   "equip <mob keyword|mob vnum> [keyword]" - equips a mob
                   in the current room with an object being carried by the
                   mob.  Wear flags are checked against what mob is currently
                   equipping, and leaving out the second argument attempts to
                   equip everything carried by mob.  Alternatively, if you
                   specify a vnum, the object will be loaded and put into
                   the mob's eq list automatically.

        UnEquip  - takes at least one argument, with the format
                   "unequip <mob keyword|mob vnum> [keyword]" - exactly
                   the same as EQUIP, but unequips stuff, sticking it in
                   the mob's carried list.

        Mount    - takes two arguments, with the format
                   "mount <mounting> <mount>" - mounts one mob atop another.
                   for example, "mount man horse"

        UnMount  - takes one argument, with the format
                   "unmount <mounting>" - unmounts a rider.  for example,
                   "unmount man"

        Follow   - takes two arguments, with the format
                   "follow <follower> <leader>" - makes one mob follow
                   another.  for example, "follow soldier general"

        UnFollow - takes one argument, with the format
                   "unfollow <follower>" - makes a mob stop following
                   another.  for example, "unfollow soldier"


  ZONE CONFIGURATION COMMANDS:

        Config        - miscellaneous configuration options, takes no
                        arguments

         DisplayConfig - configures display options, takes no arguments

         CheckConfig   - configures check options, takes no arguments

         Alias         - takes two arguments, with the format
                         "alias <alias> [aliased string]" - typing
                         'alias' by itself lists all the defined aliases,
                         typing 'alias <alias name>' displays the
                         definition of the alias (if any), and typing
                         'alias <alias name> <string>' (re)defines the
                         alias as that string.  For more information on
                         aliases/variables, see the section below.

         UnAlias       - takes one argument, with the format
                         "unalias <alias>" - removes the alias specified

         Set           - takes two arguments, with the format
                         "set <variable name> <variable value>" - for
                         instance, typing 'set textedit edit' would create
                         a variable named 'textedit' with the value 'edit'.
                         Typing "set" with no args causes a list of current
                         variables to be displayed.

         UnSet         - takes one argument, with the format
                         "unset <variable name>" - removes the variable
                          specified.

         Toggle        - takes one argument, with the format
                         "toggle <variable name>" - toggles a boolean
                         variable to the opposite value of what it is now.
                         boolean variables are considered variables
                         containing the text 'true', 'false', 'on', 'off',
                         '1', or '0'.  As with "set", typing "toggle" by
                         itself lists all boolean variables currently
                         defined.

         SetTemp       - takes three arguments, with the format
                         "settemp <flagname> <temp #> <value>" - basically,
                         this sets a certain flag in a certain template to
                         a certain value.  For more information, see the
                         section below on flag templates.  Typing "settemp"
                         by itself shows a list of non-zero flags defined
                         in all the templates.

         Guild         - this command simply toggles special guild checking

         Height        - takes up to one argument, with the format
                         "height [new height]" - if no argument is specified,
                         the current screen height setting is displayed

         Width         - takes up to one argument, with the format
                         "width [new width]" - if no argument is specified,
                         the current screen width setting is displayed


  MISCELLANEOUS COMMANDS:

      West/W, East/E,      - moves you in that direction (see also info
      North/N, South/S,      on WALKCREATE variable)
      Up/U, Down/D,

      Goto                 - takes one argument, with the format
                             "goto <vnum|keyword>" - if a vnum is
                             specified, jumps you to the room with that
                             vnum.  If a keyword is specified, jumps you
                             to the first object/mob/room title found that
                             contains that keyword.

      At                   - takes two arguments, with the format
                             "at <what> <command to exec>" - exactly like
                             the Diku equivalent, this command finds the
                             first object/mob that matches the first
                             argument and executes the command in that
                             room.  for instance, "at shaman l shaman".

      FixFlags             - sets all uneditable flags that are not set to
                             "default" values to their default values - i.e.
                             if the IS_NPC bit is not set on a mob, it will be
                             set

      FixGuildStuff        - turns off object noshow and mob aggro/hunter
                             flags - if the 'CHECKGUILDSTUFF' variable is
                             not set, you are prompted if you really want
                             to execute the command, since it would tend
                             to screw up your zone if it wasn't a guildhall

      DumpText             - dumps the text file specified in the first
                             argument to the screen (i.e. 'dumptext de.doc')

      DTC/                 - same as DUMPTEXT, but interprets Duris color codes
      DumpTextColor

      Shell                - only available under DOS, loads an instance
                             of the command shell (as determined by the
                             COMSPEC variable).  Type 'exit' to return
                             to DikuEdit.

      Save/                - saves all changes made to zone.
      Write

      Quit/                - exits editor - prompts you if changes have been
      Exit                   made.


  INFORMATIONAL COMMANDS:

        Help/?   - takes no arguments, displays a help file - HELP displays
                   the long version, ? displays a short list of all commands

        Commands - takes no arguments, shows the internal list of commands
                   in dikuEdit, three per line

        List     - takes up to two arguments, with the format
                   "list <room|exit|obj|mob|objhere/oh|mobhere/mh|quest|shop>
                    [keyword]" - does what you would expect.  if a keyword is
                   specified, operates like 'lookup' command - for exits,
                   a vnum shows only exits that lead to/from that room

        Look     - takes one argument - this command can also be used to
                   "look in" objects

        Exits    - takes no arguments, this command (much like that of
                   dikuMud) shows the titles/vnums of all the exits' destrooms
                   from the current room

        LookUp   - takes up to two arguments, with the format
                   "lookup <room|obj|mob|keyword|vnum> [keyword]" -
                   if room, obj, or mob are specified, the appropriate
                   entity type is listed - if keyword is also specified
                   in the second arg, matching is done against it.  if
                   a keyword is specified, matching rooms, objs, and
                   mobs are listed.  if a vnum is specified, ditto.

        Where    - takes one argument, with the format
                   "where <keyword|vnum>" - finds all instances of objs/
                   mobs in zone that match keyword/vnum, displaying them
                   onscreen - checks for quests that give the item and
                   shops that sell the item as well

        Stat     - takes at least one argument, with the format
                   "stat <room|obj|mob|zone> [vnum/keyword]" - shows info on
                   specified entity.  for room, if vnum is left out,
                   info on current room is shown.  for zone, second
                   argument is ignored.

        Which    - takes at least one argument, with the format
                   "which <room|obj|mob|flagname> [flagname]" - shows which
                   entities have the specified flagname set.  if room, obj,
                   or mob is specified as the first arg, only those entities
                   are checked for the flagname in the second arg.  if a
                   flagname is specified as the first arg, all rooms, objects,
                   and mobs are checked that match that flagname.

                   if an exclamation mark is placed before the flagname, all
                   entities that don't have that flag set are checked for
                   (i.e. "which m !isnpc")

        Key      - takes one argument, with the format "key [keyword/vnum]" -
                   looks for doors/objects that need the specified key.
                   if keyword is specified, object must exist in zone,
                   otherwise vnum is searched for.  if no argument is
                   specified, all objects with the keyword "key" are
                   listed.

        ZoneExits- takes no arguments, displays all exits that lead out of
                   zone.  if 'exit dests of -1 are out of zone?' variable
                   is set, includes exit dests of -1 (go figure, eh).

        Version  - displays version info on DikuEdit

        Info     - probably named too vaguely, but shows the values of
                   several internal values used for the vnum tables


  INVENTORY-RELATED COMMANDS:

       Note --.. all inventory commands can use "all" as an argument where
                 appropriate, operating on all objects in appropriate
                 location.

        Inv     - takes no arguments, displays objs/mobs in your inventory

        Get     - takes at least one argument, with the format
                  "get <keyword|vnum> [keyword|vnum]" - picks up a mob/obj in
                  the current room (or a mob/container object if second
                  keyword/vnum is specified), placing it in your inventory and
                  deleting the original - note that when picking up objects/
                  mobs, all objects inside the obj/mob are also copied.

        GetC    - same as GET, but keeps original in room/container/mob

        Drop    - takes at least one argument, with the format
                  "drop <keyword|vnum>" - drops mob/obj, placing it in current
                  room and removing it from your inventory.

        DropC   - same as DROP, but keeps original in inventory.

        Put     - takes two arguments, with the format
                  "put <keyword|vnum> <keyword|vnum>" - first argument is
                  object in inventory to put in obj/mob in room specified
                  in second argument.  Alternatively, if a vnum is specified,
                  the object is loaded and put into the container auto-
                  matically.

        PutC    - same as PUT, but keeps original in inventory




















     Some interface stuff -




        Basically, when editing object types, mob types, rooms, etc etc,
        it's all menu-driven.  It's useless to explain it, because it's
        easy to understand.

        One semi-unnoticable feature is the '<', '>', and '/' key stuff in
        the edit room/obj/mob menus - hit < (or ,) and go back an entity, hit
        > (or .) and go forward an entity.  The settings for the entity you
        are "moving away from" are saved.  Hitting '/' allows you to jump to
        a specific entity via a prompt.

        As far as flags, there are some unlisted control keys that do nifty
        stuff.  Control-F/comma (,) turns all flags off, Control-N/period (.)
        turns all flags on, and Control-T/forward slash (/) toggles all flags.

        About the command-line itself - there is a command-line history, so
        up-arrow scrolls through last commands, etc..  Home, end, delete,
        backspace, etc. all work as well (in the DOS version).


    Some display stuff -

        If you're running with a "non-standard" screen size (standard
        in this case being 80x25), you should set the "screenheight" and
        "screenwidth" variables appropriately.  This will cause lists
        to pause at the proper time, instead of pausing too early or
        too late.  Alas, screen width and height are still not truly
        properly implemented (the edit quest and shop screens and a
        few other choice places still assume 25 lines and 80 columns),
        but it doesn't hurt.


        And now the prompt - here is how it may appear onscreen -

            < 23r 32e 43ot 54ol 65mt 76ml >
            <>

        23r means 23 rooms in the zone, 32e = 32 exits, 43ot = 43 obj types,
        54ol = 54 objs loaded, 65mt = 65 mob types, 76ml = 76 mobs loaded


        Exits have two flags displayed after them, separated by a pipe (|) -
        the first flag is the door type, the second is the door state.

        For the door type flag, C means the door is closable, L means the
        door is closable/lockable, and U means the door is closable, lockable,
        and unpickable.  S/B mean the door is secret/blocked.

        For the door state flag, O means the door is loaded open, C means
        the door is loaded closed, and L means the door is loaded closed and
        locked.  S/B mean the door is loaded secret/blocked.


        If an object has the glowing, hum, noshow, buried, invis, transient,
        magic, secret, lit and/or float bits set, corresponding letters will
        be shown before the name of the object when it is lying on the ground
        in a room.  G = glowing, etc.


        Similarly, mobs with the invis, hidden, memory, sentinel, stay zone,
        protector, hunter, scavenger, teacher, wimpy, and/or aggro bits set
        will have I, H, M, S, Z, P, Hu, Sc, T, W, A (aggr all), aE (aggr evil),
        aG (aggr good), aN (aggr neut), aEr (aggr evil races), aGr (aggr
        good races), and/or aO (aggr outcasts) before their name.  Mobs with
        quest/shop info will have Q/Sh before their name.

        Also, after a mob name will be shown a bracketed letter or series of
        letters, which indicate the mob position.  Sl = sleeping, R = resting,
        Si = sitting, St = standing, L = levitated, F = flying, Sw = swimming,
        and if the pos is unrecognized, XX.  Note that the default position is
        shown.


        And finally, all these display options can be toggled on/off from the
        display config menu (detailed below).


  DEFAULT SETTINGS FILES/ZONE SPECIFIC SETTINGS FILES:

        All alias/variable/limit/template commands are written/read from
        the .SET file.

        DikuEdit handles settings files like this - first, it reads DE.SET,
        then <zonename>.SET, replacing any redundant variables, aliases, etc
        read from DE.SET.  When saving, <zonename>.SET is written with all the
        current aliases/etc.  In this manner, you can have a 'default settings'
        file and one specific to each of your zones.

        About settings file themselves - .SET files contain one command per
        line, each with the exact same format as their "inside editor"
        counterparts.  When saving, all aliases, variables, etc. are
        automatically written to a file named <zonename>.SET, and when loading,
        this file is read if existant.

        And now, a bit about the default room/object/mob files.  In the same
        manner as the .SET files, first the DE.<extension> default files
        are read, and then <zonename>.<extension>, if existant.  Thus, you
        can have a "default default room", and a default room/obj/mob/exit
        specific to each of your zones.  The extension for default rooms is
        .DWD, default objects .DOB, default mobs .DMB, and default exits .DEX.


  SETTING/USING ALIASES:

     Aliases are basically used to make life easier - basically, you define
    an alias (i.e. by typing 'alias er edit room' or having that line in
    one of your .SET files), then use it by typing 'er 1459' or 'er', etc.

     Input at the prompt is checked against aliases before the 'main'
    commands, and input must match exactly (unlike 'main' commands, which
    can be left-matched).

     And, in case it isn't completely clear, any arguments passed to the
    alias are automatically appended, so that 'er 1459' above is expanded
    to 'edit room 1459'.

     In addition, you can stick specific arguments in specific places by
    inserting "%<number>" into the alias.  For instance, suppose there is
    an alias called 'doit' defined as "edit %1 %2 23".  "doit obj blah"
    would thus be "edit obj blah 23".  If it was defined as "edit %2 %1 23",
    we'd get "edit blah obj 23".  You can use %0 to have all the arguments
    inserted.

     You can also reference variables within aliases.  Suppose you have
    'favoriteobj' set to '493'.  An alias defined as 'edit obj $favoriteobj'
    would become 'edit obj 493'.  You can mix and match variables and the
    '%<number>' stuff all you want.  Enjoy.

     Typing 'alias' by itself will show a list of currently defined aliases.
    To delete an alias, type 'unalias <aliasname>'.


  SETTING/USING VARIABLES:

     Setting variables is much like setting aliases.  Typing 'set showcolor
    true' would set the value of the variable 'showcolor' to 'true'.

     Variables can be referenced from within aliases; how is detailed
    above.

     In addition to being referencable within aliases, variables are used
    to set various internal configurable options, which are listed below
    (all/most of these variables can be set from the 'config', 'check-
    config', and 'displayconfig' menus, by the way):

      Boolean variables (set to either 'true' or 'false')

                          removing them (default false)

             WalkCreate - toggles "create room walkabout" function - if true,
                          trying to go an invalid direction creates a default
                          room in that direction with default exits leading
                          to and from the current room (default false)

                          (another variable, described below) commands
                          (including invalid commands, aliases should
                          always be considered one command) (default false)

      Non-boolean variables:

            MainZoneName - contains the "main" name of your zone - extensions
                           are added to this when saving/loading (.wld, etc).
                           this is automatically set when calling dikuEdit,
                           but can be changed inside the editor in case you
                           want to make backups, make massive changes but
                           want to save the pre-changed version, etc.

                TextEdit - contains name of external ASCII editor used for
                           editing descs/extra descs (default 'edit' ['pico'
                           for Linux]).

              MenuPrompt - contains text shown as menu prompt:
                           (default '&+CYour choice, sir? &n')

                           <Snikt - I prefer &+LSilandria whimpers, '&+RYour
                            wish, Lord Sniktiorg?&+L'&n, but I am a bit
                            twisted =).>

              MainPrompt - contains text shown as first line of main prompt -
                           if value is 'default' (which is, by the way, the
                           default), then the prompt described above is shown.

               StartRoom - contains vnum of room you were in when you last
                           saved (see SAVESTARTROOM above for more info)
                           (no default)

            ScreenHeight - contains the height of the screen (used for
                           determining when to pause when displaying
                           lists) (default is 25)

             ScreenWidth - contains the width of the screen (used for
                           determining when to pause when displaying
                           lists) (default is 80)

            SaveHowOften - determines how often zone files are autosaved
                           if SAVEEVERYXCOMMANDS variable is set to true.
                           (default is 10)

      Setting/using flag templates:

         To make setting certain flag values on certain rooms/objects/mobs
        easier, "flag templates" are available.

         Basically, there are five different templates, numbered 0 through
        4, each containing ROOMFLAG, OBJEXTRA, OBJWEAR, OBJAFF1, OBJAFF2,
        MOBACT, MOBAFF1, and MOBAFF2 flags.

         When editing, say, room flags, you can hit one of F1-F5 ('!' through
        '%' for Linux) to set the flags to the values contained in one of the
        templates (F1/! = template 0, F2/@ = 1, etc).  Hitting one of Shift-F1
        through Shift-F5 ('^' through ')' for Linux) sets the template flag for
        the corresponding template to the value currently in the room flag.

         All that you need to know is that each template contains one of each
        flags, so that the keys work on any of the flag editing menus (well,
        okay, not the zone flag menus...  damn).

         You can define the various template flag values from the command-
        line (as detailed in the SETTEMP command above), but it's probably
        much easier to just hit Shift-[Fkey] when you have the flags you
        like.

      Default room/object/mob/exit:

         How exactly DikuEdit reads the default info is described above under
        the heading "Default settings files...".

         If default room/object/mob/exit info exists, then new rooms/objects/
        mobs/exits are automatically set to the values of the default.  Thus,
        you can set the default room and exit to a forest description, turn on
        "WALKCREATE" mode, and create a forest with relative ease.

        <Snikt - don't use defroom descriptions as this just causes mad duped
         rooms, instead just set room name and flags, this way you can use the
         above dupe cheats for a better result.>

      Inventory:

         You can pick up mobs and objects and drop them throughout the zone,
        which is very handy for populating your zone.  Picking up a mob or
        object also copies (when you use Dropc) whatever objects are in the
        obj, or equipped and carried by the mob.

         Thus, you can pick up a guard mob that is in several places in the
        zone and that is equipping a sword and shield, drop copies about, and
        have a guard force ready-made.

        <Snikt, again.  At least make three different versions of the guard
         so you don't have a billion clones running about.  This also helps
         for trophy.>
